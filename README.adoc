Requirements
============

The project was built using java 7 and maven
How to run

Run it by building a jar file
------------------------------
To create a jar fie run the following maven command `mvn clean package`
this should create a file in `target/number-stringifier-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`
which can be run by running `java -jar target/number-stringifier-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`
from the main directory

Run it inside maven
-------------------
To run the project directly inside maven run `mvn package exec:java`
when you get a message like
`Please write a number: `
You can type your input to the program and press enter

Run it inside Docker
--------------------
This way of running the application is just as running it on maven but maven runs inside
a docker container
`docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/app --workdir '/app' -ti openjdk:8u121-alpine ./mvnw package exec:java`
This will take significantly longer than the other methods

You will receive the same message `Please write a number:`
